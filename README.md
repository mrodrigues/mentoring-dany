# Mentoring

This is going to be the place where we'll keep track of your progress towards being a fully-fledged developer. We'll update this repository frequently with new topics and goals, and we'll use it to track assignments.

## Assignments

The assignments are going to be created as issues with the `assignment` label, and should be closed with a commit. The assignments' code will be kept under the `./assignments` folder, and they can be either entries in a long-term project (like building an e-commerce) or detached tasks, which will be contained in their own folders. I'll create the appropriate scaffold for each exercise when appropriate.

To close an issue with a commit use a commit message like this one: `"[any message here]. Closes #123"`, replacing `[any message here]` with the appropriate description of what that commit does, and `123` with the issue's id.

## Roadmap

The topics we'll study are going to be created as issues with the `topic` label. They are going to be closed manually once we both feel that the matter was comprehensively studied. You can create any topics that you want (although it's possible that I need to modify them to make them clearer or break them down into several smaller topics).
